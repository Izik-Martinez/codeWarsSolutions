# codeWarsSolutions
I'll be completing one code wars problem each day for 100 days. This project is inspired by the community at 100devs.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, and Lua

Because code wars offers problems in a variety of programming languages, I'll be utilizing both Javascript and Lua to create solutions. I'm primarily focused on improving my Javscript, although I'm keeping Lua on the sidelines for occasional use.

## Optimizations

In the future I plan to incorporate both Javascript and Lua into a single solution/project.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter one's expereince level, there's always more to learn. 
Each time a construct a code wars solution, it gives me a surge of satisfaction that fuels my ability and passion to learn.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my repo: [thisRepo](https://github.com/Izik-Martinez/codeWarsSolutions)
